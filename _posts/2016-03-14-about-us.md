Firework was literally a finding. In a tech event, a US company found what they were looking for: web development experts who wanted to start a business. From this, Firework was born.

The team has grown, the quality and diversity of work has increased and the company reached the next level. Today, we are experts on web development, mobile, software architecture, databases, devops, agile methodologies and project management - working with customers throughout the country (Brazil) and big customers overseas as well.

Our goal is to become a company that is reference on software development and outsourcing, further expand the businesses and attend to all areas of technology with high quality and with an ever more committed team.

We understand there are two fundamental points in our business: a passion for technology from our team and the motivation to deliver to our customers the best software development experience we can.
